# Exercise 4: external data sets: Gates Foundation Educational Grants

# Use the `read.csv()` functoin to read the data from the `data/gates_money.csv`
# file into a variable called `grants` using the `read.csv()`
# Be sure to set your working directory in RStudio, and do NOT treat strings as 
# factors!
grants <- read.csv("data/gates_money.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

# Use the View function to look at the loaded data
View(grants)

# Create a variable `organization` that contains the `organization` column of 
# the dataset
organization <- grants$organization

# Confirm that the "organization" column is a vector using the `is.vector()` 
# function. 
# This is a useful debugging tip if you hit errors later!
if (is.vector(organization)) {
  print("Yes!")
} else {
  print("No!")
}

## Now you can ask some interesting questions about the dataset

# What was the mean grant value?
print(paste("The average grant value was: $", mean(grants$total_amount), sep = ""))

# What was the dollar amount of the largest grant?
print(paste("The largest grant value was: $", max(grants$total_amount), sep = ""))

# What was the dollar amount of the smallest grant?
print(paste("The smallest grant value was: $", min(grants$total_amount), sep = ""))

# Which organization received the largest grant?
print(paste(grants$organization[grants$total_amount == max(grants$total_amount)], "received the largest grant"))

# Which organization received the smallest grant?
print(paste(grants$organization[grants$total_amount == min(grants$total_amount)], "received the smallest grant"))

# How many grants were awarded in 2010?
print(paste(length(grants$start_year[grants$start_year == 2010]), "grants were awarded in 2010"))
